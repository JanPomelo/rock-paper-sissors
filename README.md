Rock Paper Sissors Game from TOP

This project is a simple plain webpage which has the classi Rock Paper Sissors Game implemented, playable via the console.
To start play, simply write play() in the console. The game will ask you to make a choice by writing it into the prompt window.
After each round, the result and current standing will be logged. As soon as one player hits 5 wins, the game is over.


In this project I learned how to do basic functions and if-loops and for-loops.
